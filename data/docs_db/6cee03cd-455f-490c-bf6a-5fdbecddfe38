## Radiation

at brain tumors. Radiation works by damaging Radiation therapy uses controlled high-energy rays to tre the DNA inside cells making them unable to divide and reproduce. The goal of radiation therapy is to maximize the dose to abnormal cells and minimize exposure to normal cells (Fig. 5). The benefits of radiation are not immediate but occur over time. Aggressive tumors, whose cells divide rapidly, typically respond more quickly to radiation. There are two ways to deliver radiation, external and internal beams.

xternal beam radiation is delivered from outside he body by a machine that aims high-energy rays x-rays, gamma rays) at the tumor. E t (

- · Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivers a high dose of radiation during a single session. Although it is called surgery, no incision is made.
- · Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSR) delivers lower doses of radiation over many visits. Patients return daily over several weeks to receive the complete radiation dose.
- · Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) delivers the radiation dose to the entire brain. It is often used to treat multiple brain tumors and metastases.

Internal radiation (brachytherapy) is delivered from nside the body by surgically placing radioactive material (sealed in catheters, seeds, or balloons) irectly into the tumor. After the patient undergoes a craniotomy to remove the tumor, the radioactive material is placed inside the tumor cavity. The radiation dose is delivered to the first few millimeters of tissue that surrounded the tumor avity where malignant cells may still remain. Patients have no risk of radiation injury to other parts of their own body or to others around them because the radiation dose is precisely delivered and short lived. i d c


## Chemotherapy

hemotherapy drugs work by interrupting cell division. However, it affects not only tumor cells but ormal cells, thus causing side effects, especially in ast growing cells (e.g., hair, digestive, blood). reatment is delivered in cycles with rest periods in etween to allow the body to rebuild healthy cells. hemotherapy drugs can be administered orally as pill, intravenously (IV), or as a wafer placed urgically into the tumor. The drugs most ommonly used to treat brain tumors are armustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and emozolomide (Temodar). Chemotherapy is also sed as a radio-sensitizing agent that increases umor cell death during radiation therapy. Agents hat often work in high-grade gliomas include rocarbazine, platinum analogs (cisplatin, arboplatin), the nitrosureas (BCNU, CCNU), and lkylating agents (temozolomide, vincristine). BCNU as been proven effective when applied locally to he tumor bed after the tumor has been removed. y applying it directly to the diseased area of the rain, side effects are limited and the drug has a outinely used for benign tumors.

## Adjunct therapies

- · Immunotherapy or biotherapy activates the immune system (T-cells and antibodies) to destroy cancer cells. Experimental research is exploring ways to prevent or treat cancer through vaccines.
- · Gene therapy uses viruses or other vectors to introduce new genetic material into tumor cells. This experimental therapy can cause tumor cells to die or increase their susceptibility to other cancer therapies.
- · Hyperbaric oxygen uses oxygen at higher than normal levels to promote wound healing and help fight infection. It may also improve the tumor's responsiveness to radiation and is being studied experimentally. Currently it is being used to help the body naturally remove dead tumor cells and treat radiation necrosis.

Figure 5. The radiation beam is shaped to match the tumor and minimize exposure to normal brain tissue. The colored rings represent the radiation dose level.

picture_counter_6 The image is an axial MRI scan of the brain, showing a specific slice (slice no. 18). There are colored contours overlaid on the scan, indicating different levels of radiation dosage (9.00 Gy, 16.00 Gy, 32.00 Gy, and 100.0% x 20.00 Gy). The contours are color-coded: green for 9.00 Gy, orange for 16.00 Gy, red for 32.00 Gy, and a combination for 100.0% x 20.00 Gy. The image also includes a small graphical representation in the bottom left corner, likely indicating the orientation or reference for the scan.


## Clinical trials

Clinical trials are research studies in which new treatments-drugs, diagnostics, procedures, and other therapies-are tested in people to see if they are safe and effective. Research is always being conducted to improve the standard of medical care. Information about current clinical trials, including eligibility, protocol, and locations, are found on the Web. Studies can be sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (see clinicaltrials.gov) as well as private industry and pharmaceutical companies (see www.centerwatch.com).
