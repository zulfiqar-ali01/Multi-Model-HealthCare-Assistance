## What treatments are available?

Treatment options vary depending on the type, grade, size and location of the tumor; whether it has spread; and your age and general health. The goal of treatment may be curative or focus on relieving symptoms (palliative care). Treatments are often used in combination with one another. The goal is to remove all or as much of the tumor as possible through surgery to minimize the chance of recurrence. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used to treat tumors that cannot be removed by surgery alone. For example, surgery may remove the bulk of the tumor and a small amount of residual tumor near a critical structure can later be treated with radiation.


## Observation

Sometimes the best treatment is observation. For example, benign, slow growing tumors that are small and have few symptoms may be observed with routine MRI scans every year until their growth or symptoms necessitate surgery. Observation may be the best option for older patients with other health conditions.


## Medication

Medications are used to control some of the common side effects of brain tumors.

- · Corticosteroid medications, such as dexamethasone (Decadron), are prescribed to reduce swelling and inflammation around the tumor. Because steroid medications can cause stomach ulcers and gastric reflux, famotidine (Pepcid) or pantoprazole (Protonix) are prescribed to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach.
- · Furosemide (Lasix) or mannitol (Osmitrol) may be used to control edema and intracranial pressure.
- · Anticonvulsant medications are used to prevent or control seizures. The most common ones include phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and levetiracetam (Keppra).


## Surgery

Surgery is the treatment of choice for brain tumors that can be reached without causing significant injury to vital parts of the brain (eloquent tissue). Surgery can help to refine the diagnosis, remove as much of the tumor as possible, and release pressure within the skull caused by the tumor. A neurosurgeon performs a craniotomy to open the

skull and remove the tumor. Sometimes only part of the tumor is removed if it is near critical areas of the brain. A partial removal can still relieve symptoms. Radiation or chemotherapy may be used on the remaining tumor cells.

Improvements in techniques, particularly imageguided surgery, intraoperative MRI/CT, and functional brain mapping have improved the surgeon's ability to precisely locate the tumor, define the tumor's borders, avoid injury to vital brain areas, and confirm the amount of tumor removal while in the operating room.
