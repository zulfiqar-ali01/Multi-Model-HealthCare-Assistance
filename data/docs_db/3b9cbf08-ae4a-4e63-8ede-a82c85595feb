## What causes brain tumors?

Medical science neither knows what causes brain tumors nor how to prevent primary tumors that start in the brain. People most at risk for brain tumors include those who have:

- · cancer elsewhere in the body
- · prolonged exposure to pesticides, industrial solvents, and other chemicals
- · inherited diseases, such as neurofibromatosis

Figure 2. Brain tumor symptoms are related to the functional areas of the brain, giving doctors clues as to the tumor location.

The regions are color-coded and labeled as follows: frontal lobe (blue), motor strip (light blue), sensory strip (orange), parietal lobe (orange), temporal lobe (green), occipital lobe (purple), cerebellum (yellow), and brainstem (pink). The image is credited to the Mayfield Clinic.

- · Memory loss
- · Paralysis on one side of the body
- · Reduced mental abilities
- · Vision loss


## Parietal lobe tumors may cause:

- · Impaired speech
- · Inability to write
- · Lack of recognition
- · Spatial disorders


## Occipital lobe tumors may cause:

- · Vision loss in one or both eyes


## Temporal lobe tumors may cause:

- · Impaired speech
- · Memory difficulty


## Brainstem tumors may cause:

- · Behavioral and emotional changes
- · Difficulty speaking and swallowing
- · Drowsiness
- · Hearing loss
- · Muscle weakness on one side of the face (e.g., head tilt, crooked smile)
- · Muscle weakness on one side of the body
- · Uncoordinated gait
