## What are the symptoms?

umors can affect the brain by destroying normal issue, compressing normal tissue, or increasing ntracranial pressure. Symptoms vary depending on he tumor's type, size, and location in the brain Fig. 2). General symptoms include: T t i t (

- · headaches that tend to worsen in the morning
- · seizures
- · stumbling, dizziness, difficulty walking
- · speech problems (e.g., difficulty finding the right word)
- · vision problems, abnormal eye movements
- · weakness on one side of the body
- · increased intracranial pressure, which causes drowsiness, headaches, nausea and vomiting, sluggish responses


## Who is affected?

The American Brain Tumor Association estimates that about 40,900 people will be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor in the US this year (rate of 14 per 100,000 people). Metastatic (secondary) brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors by at least 10 to 1, and they occur in 20% to 40% of cancer patients. The exact number of brain metastases is unknown, but it has been estimated that 98,000 to 170,000 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year. Unfortunately, each year about 12,690 people die of brain tumors in the US. Although brain tumors can occur at any age, they are most common in children 3 to 12 years old and in adults 40 to 70 years old.


## How is a diagnosis made?

First, the doctor will obtain your personal and family medical history and perform a complete physical examination. In addition to checking your general health, the doctor performs a neurological exam to check mental status and memory, cranial nerve function (sight, hearing, smell, tongue and facial movement), muscle strength, coordination, reflexes, and response to pain. Additional tests may include:

- · Audiometry, a hearing test performed by an audiologist, detects hearing loss due to tumors near the cochlear nerve (e.g., acoustic neuroma).
- · An endocrine evaluation measures hormone levels in your blood or urine to detect abnormal levels caused by pituitary tumors (e.g., Cushing's Disease).
- · A visual field acuity test is performed by a neuro-ophthalmologist to detect vision loss and missing areas in your field of view.
- · A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be performed to examine cerebrospinal fluid for tumor cells, proteins, infection, and blood.

The right scan depicts an irregularly shaped mass with heterogeneous signal intensity, indicative of a malignant tumor. The scans are labeled with "Benign" and "Malignant" respectively. The image is credited to Mayfield Clinic.

Figure 3. MRI scans of a benign and malignant brain tumor. Benign tumors have well defined edges and are more easily removed surgically. Malignant tumors have an irregular border that invades normal tissue with finger-like projections making surgical removal more difficult.
